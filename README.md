In collaboration with Pinkerton Academy, Timberlane Regional High School, School for Excellence and Bronx International High School the startkit was ordered in 2019 and build early 2020. Together the [5 Schools formed Team 426](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2020/team/426). Then the collaborative programming phase began. It mainly focused on the file `Team426Robot/scr/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java`. Some [34 commits](https://github.com/emwdx/Team426Robot/commits/master/src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java) can be seen from February 29, 2020 to March 12, 2020.
